##### Need for CAP Theorem - Case Study (Analogy) 
Let's say you are a founder of a company (Notes) in 2000 when internet has just started. This company has a helpline number 123456. This company provides services where 
1. you can call and tell them whatever you want to remember/make a note of. 
2. call and ask about your notes

We founder has a diary where we'll write the notes of the user. Any request to add a note goes to you, and any request to read a note also goes to you. But in time, when the company scales, we'd need to have multiple employees.

Now we have a distributed system.

There are multiple problems associated with a distributed system and let's talk about these.

**Case 1** (Compromise on consistency : AP system)
Lets say a customer A wants to add a reminder. The call was taken by Ram. He adds it to his diary. After a day, the same customer calls to get the reminder. But this call was received by Shyam and responds with no entry for that customer. 

Problem : Data Inconsistency. Parts of information is being stored at different places and if the same information is not stored everywhere it can lead to wrong output. 

>**Real world example**
>Lets take google as an example. Google has in house built apps like Gmail and also acquired ones like YouTube, Blogger. Each has its own distributed system. Lets say we change a data in google, like profile pic. It gets immediately updated in Google's DS, while it might take time to be updated in YouTube and Blogger. Meanwhile, they display the older profile pic.

Here we have a system which is partition tolerant, available but not consistent.

**Case 2** (Compromise on availability : CP system)
**Earlier**, the employee put the note on their diary and then tell the customer about the success. 
>Now, they not only store in their diary, but also on every other's diaries and responds success.

Problem:
Unavailability. What if there's a partition, i.e. inter employee communication is down, and employees are not in sync. In this scenario, a customer might call another employee and they might give inconsistent data. In order to prevent this data inconsistency, all employees will not respond unless all are in sync. This leads to data unavailability. 

**Will there be any inconsistency?**
As long as no employees response to customers unless in sync, there won't be data inconsistency.

Here we have a system which is partition tolerant and consistent, but may not be available.

**Case 3** (Compromise on partition tolerance : AC system)
Now let's imagine a system where the employees will always be present and will be in sync. Here, we have availability and consistency, but this system is not partition tolerant as we are assuming there won't be any partition.

In reality there will be partition and we have to always design a system with partition tolerance in mind. Partitions are inevitable.

###### CAP Theorem
The CAP theorem states thatÂ a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three properties at any given time: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

**whenever we do system design, we need to ask if we are building a CA, CP or AC system.**

Lets see which property among consistency and availability we should have in a scenario
1. Banking System
Lets say we are trying to withdraw amount through an ATM. The system currently has network issue between ATMs (partition). If we allow this transaction and have availability, then there will be data inconsistency. Obviously this is not preferred. Therefore, in a banking system, we'll compromise on availability and choose consistency.

2. Facebook News Feed
We know in FB News feed we'd have multiple machines. Lets say there's partition. In this case would it not be available to the user or rather show the inconsistent data? Obviously for UX, FB can compromise on consistency, so it choose availability. e.g. Reddit chat etc.

In most cases, choice between the two depends on the business purpose.

#### 2. PACELC Theorem
PACELC expands on CAP by addressing trade-offs during **normal operation** when no partition exists.

PACELC states that:

- **In case of Partition (P):** A distributed system must choose between **Availability (A)** and **Consistency (C)** (as per the CAP theorem).
- **Else (E):** When there is no partition, the system must trade-off between **Latency (L)** and **Consistency (C)**.

Lets talk about a normal situation when there's no network partition. When a request is made, we can 
- first process it, updates it on all machines and then returns success. In this case, we have high latency. 
- first process it, return success and then update on other machines. Here, we have low consistency.

#### 3. Database Systems
In a DB machine, there can be read and write queries. The ratio of both are not typically 1:1
e.g. in FB posts is a read heavy system.
e.g. Orders in stock market is somewhat balanced 
e.g. Analytic system/Log system for tracking data, it'll be more write heavy

>There are no DB in the world which can handle both large number of read and large number of writes. 
_____

We would need a system which can handle many queries. We'd also need fault tolerance, high availability etc.

Add more shards (Wrong)  - Adding more shards won't work, because more shards will only reduce the data stored on other shard, while the load handled for a certain query remain the same for the machine which has that data. There is no fault tolerance either.

#### Master-Slave architecture
![[Screenshot 2025-01-21 174729.png]]

Here each shard is connected to multiple database machines which has copies of the shard data. 
- The main DB machine handles all the write queries (Master machine) 
- The replica machines stay in sync with the master machine and handles the read queries. (Slave machines).
- This way any large number of read queries will be distributed across the replicas making read queries fast. 
- We also have backups thus having fault tolerance and availability.

Problem: What if master and slave are not in sync (Network partition). We can have inconsistent system. 

- **100% consistent master-slave setup(Write to all or none)**
When a write query comes, 
- master will write to all slaves.
- returns success.
- If data was not writable in any slave, we return failure.
**pros: read can happen from any machine**
**con: writes will be slower**

- **100% available master-slave setup**
When a write query comes,
- Only save to master
- return success
- save to other machines
**pros: writes are faster
cons: read cannot happen from any machine. Consistency is compromised**

100% Available system can be 
- Eventually consistent
Sooner or later, all machines will have the same value
e.g. Facebook news feed. You may not want to be consistent now, but consistency later would be required.

- Never consistent
It can happen that machines are never in sync. This typically happen when master tries to write to slave. If its a failure, the process is dropped. This is used in places where 100% consistency is not required now or never. e.g. Used in analytical systems, where some data can be inconsistent.
