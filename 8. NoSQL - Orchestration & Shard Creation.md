#### 1. Types of NoSQL Databases
Type of NoSQL databases is decided by the type of functionality that it is optimized for.
1. Key-Value Pair Database
Data is stored as key-value pairs. Typically it is used when we don't have a fixed datatype for value.

**NOTE** : Key value pairs can be added to SQL as well. But in SQL we need to provide a fixed datatype for key and value. SQL also involves complex query language as well.

Therefore for storing simple K-V pairs where the values can be of multiple types, we can go for K-V DBs. Also the only types of queries you do are on keys i.e. get and set operations. Knowing this, we can further optimize these get and set operations much better than a normal SQL DB.
e.g. A same server can cache the whole HTML page as JSON against key url, and also cache the contest input file against file name.

Redis, Dynamo DB are K-V databases.

- K-V databases are only optimal in getting and setting values and not for any queries on the value itself
Imagine a scenario where you are storing url to JSON file. Inside the JSON we have a list of teachers. Now the query is to get all the teachers with rating more than 4. This query is not optimal in K-V database.

2. Document Database
They are key value pairs where the values are JSONs. 
Document databases are used 
- to store unstructured data, i.e. databases where each entity can have different sets of attributes like in the E-Commerce example. 
- when queries on attributes are expected.

MongoDB, Elastic search  document databases.

3. Column Database
Databases which store data as columns instead of rows are called Column databases.
**Why column databases are used and where do they come in handy?**
To answer this, first lets learn how normal SQL databases store data. Let's take a Product table as an example, 

Products

| productId | Name   | Price | userId |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| 1         | phone  | 20000 | xyz    |
| 2         | fridge | 30000 | abc    |
| 3         | tv     | 25000 | xxx    |
In memory, this gets saved in sequence, as

|     |       |       |     |     |        |       |     |     |     |       |     |
| --- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- |
| 1   | phone | 20000 | xyz | 2   | fridge | 30000 | abc | 3   | tv  | 25000 | xxx |
while the data gets read from memory, they are first fetched as a strip first added to the cache. Next time read happens, first the cache is read first to see if it contains the data. This is to reduce the number of disk reads as they are slower. 

Now lets analyze a few queries and how the queries are executed in memory where 5 data are fetched at a time.

- SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS
disk read 1 :

|     |       |       |     |     |
| --- | ----- | ----- | --- | --- |
| 1   | phone | 20000 | xyz | 2   |

from the first read itself we get all the data to print row 1.
Similary we'll carry out the rest of the row reads. There will be around 3 disk reads.

- SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS WHERE amount>30000
Here only row 2 is to be printed, yet we had 3 disk reads.

- SELECT sum(amount) FROM Products WHERE userId=xyz
Here when only sum was required, we still fetched all rows with 3 disk reads.

**Advantages of Columnar DB for Disk Reads**
In Column DB, the above data is stored as

```
productId Column  : [1, 2, 3]
Name Column       : ["phone", "fridge", "tv"]
Price Column      : [20000, 30000, 25000]
userId Column     : ["xyz", "abc", "xxx"]
```


Column DB might even have columns indexed.

- SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS
 **Column DB**: Reads all columns individually. Since all columns are needed, disk reads are same.

- SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS WHERE amount > 30000**
**Column DB**:
    - Only the `Price` column is read from disk.
    - Filtering is applied directly on the `Price` column, significantly reducing the amount of data read.
    - Once the matching rows are identified, their corresponding `productId`, `Name`, and `userId` can be fetched (if needed).

- SELECT SUM(price) FROM PRODUCTS WHERE userId = 'xyz'
**Column DB**:
    - First, only the `userId` column is read to identify rows where `userId = 'xyz'`.
    - Then, only the `Price` column is read for the matching rows.
    - This approach minimizes disk reads by accessing only the required columns.

One con is if you are inserting a row, it can lead to a lot of insertions.

- Another advantage of Columnar DB - **Compacting**
Example of compacting - aaaabbccccccddd => 4a2b6c3d
In row based DBs, two consecutive data do not tend to be same, meanwhile column based DB can have same sequential value as all data of a column tend to be the same. In such cases compacting saves memory and aggregation query etc further.

Used in data analysis jobs where they are more aggregation queries like sum, average of data. Typically companies use SQL for storing data and Column databases for analytic processes.

4. Graph databases
When you have to store data which got relations between different entities, we go for graph dbs.

5. Time series DB
A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for [time-stamped or time series data](https://www.influxdata.com/what-is-time-series-data/). Time series data are simply measurements or events that are tracked, monitored, downsampled, and aggregated over time. This could be server metrics, application performance monitoring, network data, sensor data, events, clicks, trades in a market, and many other types of analytics data.

A [time series database](https://www.influxdata.com/comparison/) is built specifically for handling metrics and events or measurements that are time-stamped. A TSDB is optimized for measuring change over time.

#### 2. Case Studies
1. Twitter 
Twitter got a lot of hashtags. When clicked, it shows a lots of tweets of that particular hashtags. We have to store for each hash tag, recent tweets of that particular hashtag where we are fetching the tweets incrementally .i.e. first 10, if the person is still scrolling down, then the next 10.

- Relational DB
Bad choice, as tweets can be written quick for a hashtag. Relational comes with latency. 

- Key-value pair
For every tweet, key will be hashtag against a list of all tweets for that tag. Bad choice as we wont be able to do queries on value. Here if we need sequential fetching, then operations on value will be needed.

- Document DB
Purpose of Document DB is when we have unstructured data. But here all tweets have the same structure. 

- Column family
If writes are append only they can be handled very fast. Here new tweets are only appended. Therefore this is the right answer.

2. Live score of a Match
We are only interested in the current score of the match. A simple key value pair DB would suffice and is optimal.

If we needed the score history, then time series might be the right answer.

3. Uber 
Current location of every Uber driver
Again, key-value. If you had to store history, then column or time series.
