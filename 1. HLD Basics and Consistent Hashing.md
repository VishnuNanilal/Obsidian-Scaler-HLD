#### 1. System Design
System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modeules, interfaces and data for a system to satisfy specific requirements. It involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase, while considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance.

It consists of 
i. LLD
ii. HLD

LLD - Design of schemas of classes, modules, databases and their relationships
**HLD** - Scalability, maintainability, low latency, reliability, architecture, DB decisions, cache decision, availability, algorithms to use etc.
It's about problem solving rather than knowledge of which app use which functionality and such. 

#### 2. Why do we use Distributed Systems?
case study: del.icio.us
Started from a college laptop during internet explorer times. During those times, there was no way to bookmark webpages or sites. **del.icio.us** had two functionalities, to bookmark pages and to view those bookmarks from multiple laptops. **del.icio.us** was served through the founder's laptop or server. Obviously, the founder wanted others to access their websites. How was that possible? Users would search **del.icio.us** using a browser, but how would a browser know where **del.icio.us** files could be fetched from? What if there were multiple **del.icio.us** sites out there? That would cause ambiguity. Name of the website is not enough to locate the servers of the website.

##### IP addresses
An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It is provided by the ISP and all IP addresses are managed by an org called **ICANN**. It serves two primary functions:

1. **Identification**: Identifies the host or device on the network.
2. **Location Addressing**: Specifies the location of the device in the network.

###### Types of IP Addresses:
1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**:
    - Format: 32-bit address.
    - Example: `192.168.1.1`.
    - Consists of four decimal numbers separated by dots (each number ranges from 0 to 255).
2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**:
    - Format: 128-bit address.
    - Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
    - Designed to replace IPv4 due to address exhaustion, offering a vastly larger address space.

Now using IP addresses we can identity and locate each device connected to an internet without ambiguity as internet works around IP addresses.  

#### 3. DNS(Domain name system)
While internet works on IP addresses, humans are bad with numbers. Therefore a domain name is assigned to IP addresses which users can remember. e.g.: www.google.com
When we browse using a domain name, the request is first sent to a DNS. This DNS has a registry for all domain name to their IP addresses. From this, the IP address of the domain is sent back to the client as response. After this, the browser sends the request to the IP address received.

###### How will we reach the DNS in the first place?
When a laptop connects to the internet through an ISP, the ISP's **DNS servers** are automatically configured as the default DNS via **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**. You can manually set DNS as any other e.g. 8.8.8.8 provided by Google.
###### Who manages DNS servers
ICANN manages DNS globally. On a localized scale, Domain registrars like GoDaddy, DNS Hosting providers like Cloudflare, Amazon Route 53, Network Admins within a company or your ISP manages the DNS. ICANN acts like a wholesaler while the rest as local shops.
###### How can DNS servers know the latest IP address of every website?
Globally ICANN manages the DNS. The source of truth of every IP addresses of every Doman name lies with ICANN. There are 13 *Root Domain name servers* managed by ICANN. 

Whenever someone changes the IP address of a website, the ICANN gets to know first. Google DNS, ISP etc. need to sync with ICANN to have the updates DNS. This is why DNS settings typically take time (0-24hours).

fetching the delta: During every 1 hour or so, all local DNS servers request the ICANN all the DNS settings that has changed. This keeps them in sync with ICANN. This process is called 'fetching the delta'.
###### Why other DNS servers when we have ICANN
ICANN and 13 Root DNS alone cant cater to the entire global DNS needs. They exist as a source of truth while the rest provides the service more locally.

#### 4. Static v/s Dynamic IP address
We know all system connected to the internet will be provided with an IP address (by ISP for example). Every time we connect, the IP address provided to you may change. This change is set up by the IP provider in order to efficiently allocate IP addresses to those who need it, as they themselves pay money to ICANN for those IP addresses. Therefore unused to IP addresses will be reassigned or such. Such changing IP addresses which doesn't stay are called dynamic IP addresses.  

But for a server, having a changing IP address is an issue as if it changes, then it needs to be updated on ICANN and other DNS, during which the server might be down. Therefore in order to provide continuous service, servers need to have a static IP address. Static IP addresses cost extra money.

###### Private IP address and internet
Private internet are a subnet which has a common public IP address(gateway) connected to public internet. A router or gateway in the network with a public IP address is responsible for translating between private IP addresses and the public internet. This process is called Network Address Translation (NAT).

Therefore in order to provide a public server, we need a **public static IP address**.
