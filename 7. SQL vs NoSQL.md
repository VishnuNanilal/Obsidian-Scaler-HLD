#### 1. Introduction to SQL
Lets talk about some positive features of SQL
1.  **Avoiding duplication through Data normalization**
**Data normalization** is the process of organizing a database's structure to minimize redundancy and dependency. It typically involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.

Through this, we can avoid data inconsistency. 
In SQL this is possible through JOINS. Normalized data can still be combined. 

If JOINS are slow, we might have to go for duplication. In distributed systems, data might be present in different machines which causes JOIN to be slow.

2. **ACID requirements**
ACID requirements are some of the crucial properties SQL offers. 
- Atomicity - each operations are either treated completely or as if not at all executed.
-  Consistency - In ACID,  consistency means the logical correctness or accuracy of data. (Consistency in ACID is different from the consistency in CAP where sameness of data present in multiple locations.) 
-  Isolation - One process should be isolated and not should adversely affect another transaction.
-  Durability - Once a process has been completed, the data should be persistent. 

In distributed systems, maintaining **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) across multiple machines is challenging because it often requires complex coordination, which can impact performance and scalability. 
###### **Challenges of ACID in DS**:
-  **Atomicity**: Ensuring all parts of a transaction succeed or fail is difficult when data spans multiple machines.
-  **Consistency**: All replicas must have the same state after a transaction. In distributed nodes requires synchronous replication, which adds latency.
-  **Isolation**: Preventing interference between concurrent transactions requires locking resources on multiple machines.
-  **Durability**: Ensuring data is permanently saved even after failures needs replication and reliable storage.

**In other words, SQL can have all ACID properties and still not have too many latency only when it's working on the same machine and not a DS.**

3. **Defined structure**
SQL has a defined schema or structure. This defined structure can also be an issue for DS.

e.g. An E-Commerce website
A shirt will have attributes like size, material...
A laptop - RAM, Screen refresh rate...

Different products has different attributes. 
- Creating a general table for all products will lead to redundant columns and very large tables.
- Creating specific tables for products will lead to large number of tables. (Amazon has 25000 products)
- Using metadata as string. In this design, we store product id and the rest as metadata as JSON for each product specific to it. This leads to inefficient querying. e.g. Select all shirts of size XXL.

**Conclusion**
Properties like 
- Normalization
- ACID
- Structured design 
provided by SQL can cause issues in DS.

**Choice between SQL and NoSQL**
- Evaluate SQL first. 
- See if there's any problems with it based on the above properties.
- If no, stick to SQL
- If yes go for alternative ones 

##### What if when size of data is huge?
- Split Data
Ideally try to split data in a way that SQL database will work. Normally we split data based on **Sharding key**

#### 2. How to decide the sharding key?
1. Case Study: Messenger App

A messenger app Schema looks like

| message_id | sender_id | receiver_id | content | sent_at | is_read |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|            |           |             |         |         |         |
|            |           |             |         |         |         |

**Which sharding key will we use?**
- sender_id
The first idea would be to use sender_id as sharding key. This is bad, because each chat can have multiple people's chats. This means we **may** have to query multiple DB machines if chats are sharded by sender_id.
For seeing chat list when you open the app, you may have to query even more machines.

- time
This is a problem because, we have to move data everyday. Also there will be uneven distribution across DB machines. DB holding older data will be overloaded.

------
**Conclusion**
1. So we should choose a DB which makes the queries fast.
2. We should shard such that the load across the machines are uniform

**We cannot see any attribute based on which we can achieve these two. In such cases we should try to make a new table.**
Lets create a new table, conversation which consists of chats between two people.

Conversations

| Conversation_id | user_1 | user_2 | last_sent |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
Messages

| message_id | conversation_id | content |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------- |
|            | RK              |         |

2. Case Study: Banking System

Accounts

| account_id | owner_name | branch | city | type | balance |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ | ---- | ---- | ------- |
Operations available
1. Get balance of an account
2. Get transaction history of an account

Transactions

| id  | account_id | amount | type |
| --- | ---------- | ------ | ---- |
**Get balance of an account**
We have to shard such that we know the information of an account is present in a machine. If we shard based on account_id, we can achieve this. 
**Get transaction history of an account**
All transaction history of an account should ideally be in one machine. Again, if we shard based on acccount_id, this is achieved. 

Sharding key - account_id

3. Case Study: Uber
People should be able to search cars near them

Drivers

| driver_id | name | car_no | city_id | lat long |
| --------- | ---- | ------ | ------- | -------- |
|           |      |        |         |          |
- Lat long
Lets say we shard by lat long for the requirement i.e. all drivers who are in a given lat long will be in the same machine. The problem is, even if two cars are near to each other, unless they have the same exact lat long, they might not be in the same DB machine.

- City Id 
All of the cars which are in the same city will be in the same machine.

4. Case Study: Slack
Messages

| id  | user_id | group_id | content | time | workspace_id |
| --- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ---- | ------------ |
- workspace_id
Normally works, but workspace can grow too large to be contained in the DB machine. Sharding key should be such that the data should not overflow the DB machine itself.

- group_id
This is exactly the same as the conversation id in whatsapp.

4. IRCTC
Requirements
- Should be able to get all bookings for a particular train to be able to assign seats
- The same seat shouldn't be booked twice

Tickets

| id  | no_of_people | date | start_loc | end_loc | start_loc_train | end_loc_train |
| --- | ------------ | ---- | --------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------- |
|     |              |      |           |         |                 |               |
 Potential sharding keys
 - train_id
 - start_of_train
 - train_id+date

**train_id**
For requirement 1, if we use train_id, then all tickets of a particular train will be in one DB machine. This makes req 1 fast.

**start_of_train**
All bookings with train starting from one location, will also make re1 fast. Problem is, this can lead to uneven distribution as well as overloading.

**train_id+date of journey**
All of the tickets with the same train_id and date_of_journey will be in the same machine. This is the most optimal sharding for requirement 1.

- **How to choose sharding key?** 
1. Makes the query ideally search in only one DB machine.
2. Load across machines should be even.
3. Do not choose broad sharding key.
4. If all of the rows which have the same **needed** attributes will be in the same machine, then a sharding key with those attributes will be the best.
